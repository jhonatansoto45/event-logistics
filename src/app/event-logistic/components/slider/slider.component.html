          Enjoy a quiet getaway in this charming cottage renovated, designed,
          and owned by Chip and Joanna Gaines. Originally the carriage house for
          Hillcrest Estate, this home includes one bedroom, one bath, an office
          nook and a private back patio. This makes it the perfect getaway for a
          party of two, or if you're stopping through town and need a restful
          place to retreat.
